# (PISA2012 Data Exploration)
## by (HAMZAT ABDULRAHMAN)


## Dataset
The PISA2012 Data is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education.
About 490,000 15-year-old students in 65 economies contained in this dataset took part in the PISA2012 assessment of reading,mathematics, and science. The assessment is a measure of their ability to use these knowledge and skills to meet real life challenges. Of those economies, 44 economies took part in an assessment of creative problem solving, and 18 economies took part in an assessment of financial literacy. The dataset contains a wealth of information on students' background, their school and the organisation of education system.
The PISA 2012 dataset is available as rda file [here](http://beta.icm.edu.pl/PISAcontest/data).

## Summary of Findings
My main feature of interest in the dataset are factors that affect or are directly related to the performance of pupils in Mathematics asessment. 
In the exploration I found the following:
* Those who are in possession of textbooks have a higher mean performance score in Mathematics than those who don't have.
* Most of those who scored higher than 700 in Mathematics opined that a likeness for complex problem solving is "somewhat" - "mostly" like them.
* The lower the degree of likeliness that the reading material is hard, the higher the mean performance score in Mathematics.
* Pupils from OECD countries performed quite better in Mathematics than their counterparts from Non-OECD countries.
* Even though more Females than males agreed to "Interest in Mathematics - Reading", and also more females than males do not perceive the material to be too hard,the male genders have a slightly higher Mathematics performance mean score than the females.
A deeper look at the multivariate relationship shows that, this could be due to the fact that there are more males than females - of those who scored above 700 in mathematics performance.

* Outside of the main variable of interest, I discovered that irrespective of the pupils' level of interest in Mathematics - Enjoy Reading, those who possess textbook are always more than those who don't.

Only the first three findings were introduced as key insights for presentation.

## Key Insights for Presentation
To start with, I introduced the histogram distribution of the performance scores in Mathematics, and noted all observations. Then I presented the relationship between Possession of Textbooks and the mean performance score. Next is the comparison for how the likeness for solving complex problem paid off for pupils who had a very high score. Lastly, I showed the linear relationship between the "attribution to failure - material too hard" and the mean performance score.
The changes in design are removal of border lines,increasing the data-ink ratio, addition of proportion labels to bars to make comprehension easier and titles and removing ticks where necessary.
I also made sure to use different color_palette for each qualitative variable to make sure it is clear but not confusing.
